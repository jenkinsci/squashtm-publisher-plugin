bsiri, 2017-08-17, version 0.2.0.RC3-SNAPSHOT

The problem
--------------------

In the current state the plugin cannot be tested using `gradlew server` (or gradlewSrv).

The plugin requires :
* jenkins-core 1.651.3 or above
* junit plugin 1.10 or above (see build.gradle > dependencies > jenkinsPlugins)

The environment prepped by `gradlew server` is :
* jenkins-core 1.651.3
* junit plugin < 1.10

In order to fix that the solution used to manually upgrade that plugin via the administration menu. The upgrade mechanism
doesn't allow to pick a specific version, it always update to the last version. It worked fine until junit 1.19 (last time
I checked).

A few days ago junit 1.22-SNAPSHOT was released and became the only version you can upgrade to, however it totally breaks
jenkins 1.651 which seems now too old (fair point).

As we will now see, upgrading to a newer Jenkins poses more problems that we cannot afford to solve right now because
release dates is tomorrow.


Temporary solution
-------------------

Use an external Jenkins, preferably Jenkins 2 or above. This situation of course must not last.


Target solution
-------------------

Upgrade the minimal version of Jenkins to something more up-to-date. Problems are :

1/ strategic : should we stop support for Jenkins 1 ?

2/ technical : changing Jenkins core version is not enough, and depending on the version different problems arise (see below).


Candidate solution : upgrade jenkins-core
------------------------------------------

As stated above changing `jenkinsVer` in `gradle.properties` leads to more problems :

* version 2.1, 2.2 : the plugin doesn't compile. It seems related to https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33581 since an inspection
of `gradlew dependencies` shows that indeed the modules jenkins-core and stapler-groovy require different versions of groovy-all

* version 2.60 : the unit test fail because Spock cannot mock some classes, it would require cglib-nodep 2.2 or higher. What I
don't understand yet is that the said classes are imported at same version in both case (junit 1.22-SNAPSHOT), so it makes no
sense that the version of jenkins-core would have an impact on this

* version 2.74 : cannot find some jar in any repository, I believe the name is like jenkins-war-for-test


Candidate solution : upgrade the gradle jenkins-ci.jpi plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------

I don't know much yet on the overall issue but this might help with the various problems stated above. Be careful though :
newer versions don't declare 'maven-publish'. So remember to add it to the applied plugins otherwise the gradle script will
break (the group 'publishing' will stay undefined).
