# Squash TM publisher #


## Description ##
This plugin publishes the test results of a Jenkins build in [Squash TM](http://squashtest.org/en/decouvrir-squash-tm/contenu-statique/outils-et-fonctionnalites/squash-tm-test-management-en). It works on top of other publisher plugins dedicated to the test technology that used in the build (junit, nunit, mstest etc), before pushing the results.


## Usage ##
The plugin leverages the workflow implemented in the [Squash TM / Squash TA integration scenario](https://sites.google.com/a/henix.fr/wiki-squash-ta/tm---ta-guide/user-guide). In a few words, it allows Squash TM to list the tests of a job, trigger a build and gather the test results, with some restrictions (listed in section [Comparison with Squash TA](#comparison-with-squash-ta)). The job can be of any nature (free-style or else) and use any test technology (if a Jenkins plugin is also configured for it).

Also, due to the nature of that workflow please note that in this version the publisher will process the results **only if the build was triggered by Squash TM**. This limitation will be addressed in future developments.


## Future developments ##
In the future we plan to add the following features :

* publish the test results continuously,
* simplify the deployment of Squash TA projects.


## Dependencies ##
This plugin works for Jenkins version 1.651.3 or higher and requires JUnit plugin v1.19+ (not tested with earlier versions).


## License ##

This plugin is licensed under the [MIT licence (Expat)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Sponsoring ##

[Squash TM](http://squashtest.org/en/decouvrir-squash-tm/contenu-statique/outils-et-fonctionnalites/squash-tm-test-management-en) and the present plugin are both
developed by [Henix]('https://www.henix.com/').


# Configuration #

## Global settings ##

As an administrator, go to the system configuration (first item in the administrator view). Scroll down to the TM Publisher section. From there you can add one or several TM servers by clicking on the 'add' button and filling the following informations : 

* server name : a label that identify a given instance of Squash TM
* server URL : the base URL of the TM server
* login : the login of the account on Squash TM that Jenkins will use to push the results. NB : that user must belong to the 'Test Automation Server' user group.
* password : the password of that user.

These will allow the plugin to identify instances of Squash TM that request for result update, and to authenticate on them.

The 'validate' button (next to 'delete') will test that the server is reachable and up. For now the credentials aren't validated yet. Potential errors in your configuration will issue a warning. Once you are done save the configuration as usual. You can save the configuration even if warnings were reported, e.g. when the endpoint is down at the moment yet the URL is correct nonetheless.


## Job Settings ##

As a job manager, go to the configuration page of your job.

Jobs of all nature are supported. As a job manager, go to the configuration page of your job. In order to work the plugin requires two simple items. First, on the general job properties, tick the box 'Enable integration with Squash TM'.
![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/135462990/jenkins_general.PNG?version=1&modificationDate=1504109199000&api=v2)
Then add a new post-build step : 'Publish your tests results on Squash TM'.
![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/135462990/jenkins_publish_tm.PNG?version=1&modificationDate=1504109198000&api=v2)

That's all you need to configure TM-publisher per-se. However you will also need to configure additional test result publishers such as [JUnit plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JUnit+Plugin), [NUnit plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/NUnit+Plugin), [JSUnit plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JSUnit+plugin) etc. Remember that TM-publisher simply pushes tests results, it does not generate them.

Note that 'Maven project' job style implicitly handle jUnit test results : if you run a Maven job and your tests are run by a jUnit runner you don't need to configure extra test results publishers.

In some cases, further configuration is needed to access the reports.

The following example is a Junit test with Gradle :

* As a job manager, go to the configuration page of your job then to
    the ‘*Post-build Actions*’ tab
* Add a new post-build action: ‘*Publish Junit test result report*’
* Fill in the ‘*Test report XMLs field*’ with the path of your test
    reports
* Make sure the ‘*Publish Junit test result report*’ action is above
    ‘*Publish your tests results on Squash TM*’.

# Squash TM configuration

## Configure Squash TM properties

* Open the **squash.tm.cfg.properties** file located in the conf
    folder of Squash TM installation folder (ex : C:\\Squash-TM\\conf)
* Look for **tm.test.automation.server.callbackurl** and uncomment it
* Add the Squash TM url (ex: <http://192.168.2.138:8080/squash>). This
    URL will be used by Squash4Jenkins to notify Squash TM of the
    execution progress
* Restart Squash TM

## Add a Jenkins instance to Squash TM

### Create a Test Automation Server User

You only need to create one automated server user, even if you want to
add several automated servers.

* In Squash TM, as an administrator, click on *Administration* (in the
    upper corner) then click on *Users.*
* Click on **\[Add\]**. A popup displays
* In the *Group* field, select *Test Automation Server*.
* Fill in the *Login* and *Password* fields with the login and
    password you have configured in Jenkins (in system configuration).
* Click on **\[Add\].**

### Create a Test Automation Server

* In Squash TM, click on *Administration* (in the upper corner) then
    click on *Automation servers*.
* Click on **\[Add\]**. A popup displays.
* Fill in the URL field with the Jenkins url (ex :
    <http://localhost:9080/jenkins).>

# User guide

## Create an automated test

* In the *Test Cases Workspace*, select a project that is
    automation-ready
* Click on **\[+\]** to create a new test case
* Fill in the '*Name*' field and click on **\[Add\]**
* On the *Auto. script* field, click on '**Click to edit...**'

![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/135462990/squash_tc_auto_script.png?version=1&modificationDate=1504183929000&api=v2)

* Associate the automation script to the test case. You can type the
    name of the script (/TM\_JOB\_NAME/Path\_to\_the\_script) or use the
    **\[Pick...\]** button

The TM\_JOB\_NAME will be checked, but the path\_to\_the\_script won't.

# Comparison with Squash TA #

The main user stories implemented by a regular Squash TM-TA stack are fullfiled by the TM-publisher, but not all. Because the TM-publisher plugin makes no assumption about the actual build tools and test runners involved in the Jenkins build, many advanced features from Squash TA are not available here due to integration problems.

The following features are supported : 

* TM user can bind a test case to a remote test hosted on Jenkins
* TM user can start automated test suites
* Test statuses are updated automatically on build completion

The following features are **NOT** supported :

* Passing datasets to the automated tests
* Running only a subset of the test suite : the job will run entirely and all tests will be run
* Dispatch the tests on available slave nodes
* Running tests in a specified order
* Real-time status updates : all results will be pushed at the end of the build
